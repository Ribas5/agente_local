# 5. Avoid Redundancy in contentDescription

**Important:**

> Screen readers like TalkBack and VoiceOver already announce the component type (such as “button” or “text field”). Therefore:

✅ Correct:

```kotlin
contentDescription = "Confirm submission"
```

❌ Incorrect:

```kotlin
contentDescription = "Button confirm submission"
```

This prevents the reader from saying “button button confirm submission”.
