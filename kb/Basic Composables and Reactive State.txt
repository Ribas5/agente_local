# 2. Basic Composables and Reactive State

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TextExample() {
    Text(text = "Simple text")
}

@Composable
fun Counter() {
    var count by rememberSaveable { mutableStateOf(0) }
    Button(onClick = { count++ }) {
        Text("Click: $count")
    }
}
```

Always use `rememberSaveable` when the state needs to survive recomposition.
